# Plagiarism-Detector
This project builds a plagiarism detector that examines a text file and performs binary classification; labeling that file as either plagiarized or not, depending on how similar that text file is to a provided source text.

This project utilizes pandas, numpy, scikit-learn and AWS Sagemaker for the end to end process.
